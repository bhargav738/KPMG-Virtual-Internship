# KPMG-AU-Data-Analytics-virtual-internship
This repository contains my solutions and project work for the KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship offered by Forage. The virtual internship provides a hands-on learning experience in data analytics, allowing participants to gain practical skills and insights into the tasks and challenges faced by professionals at KPMG.

## About the Internship
The KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship is designed to simulate a real-world data analytics project. Participants will work on a fictional client project, analyzing data and providing insights to drive business decisions. The internship offers a comprehensive learning journey, covering various aspects of data analytics, including data quality assessment, exploratory data analysis, data preparation, data visualization, and presentation of findings.

## Project Objectives
The primary goals of the virtual internship are to:
-Acquire hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization.
-Implement data cleaning and preparation techniques to ensure high-quality data.
-Leverage data analytics tools and methods for exploratory data analysis.
-Create impactful visualizations and dashboards to effectively present insights.
-Deliver actionable recommendations based on data analysis to solve the client's business challenges."


## Tasks and Solutions
During the virtual internship, I completed a series of tasks involving data analysis and visualization techniques. Each task is thoroughly documented in the respective Jupyter Notebooks within the first two directories. Furthermore, the visualizations and dashboards created throughout the internship are available in the '3. Data Insights and Presentation/' directory.


## Acknowledgements
I am grateful to KPMG and Forage for offering this virtual internship and providing the resources needed to advance my data analytics skills. This experience has been incredibly valuable, enabling me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world projects.
